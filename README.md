# CPU_TempLogger
This is a CPU temperature logger for use with the eggscope/loascope

Data is recorded to Phone\Android\data\com.example.cpulogger\files with the file labeled "CPULoggerData_YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss".  /n
Only one file should be created for each instance of the app being opened

Important to note: 
Currently the app does not record temperatures when app is sent to the background but will resume recording automatically when brought back to the forefront
